WARNING:MapLib:328 - Block XLXI_6136 is not a recognized logical block. The
   mapper will continue to process the design but there may be design problems
   if this block does not get trimmed.
WARNING:MapLib:328 - Block XLXI_6227/ec_wrapper/xgmii is not a recognized
   logical block. The mapper will continue to process the design but there may
   be design problems if this block does not get trimmed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal U10_2 connected to top level port U10_2 has been
   removed.
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFG symbol
   "XLXI_5952" (output signal=CLK_187_5) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads.
   The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I1 of XLXI_6004/I_36_8
WARNING:LIT:178 - Clock buffer BUFG symbol "XLXI_5993" (output signal=CLK_375)
   does not drive clock loads. Driving only non-clock loads with a clock buffer
   will cause ALL of the dedicated clock routing resources for this buffer to be
   wasted. The non-clock loads are:

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  44 block(s) removed
 271 block(s) optimized away
  35 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
