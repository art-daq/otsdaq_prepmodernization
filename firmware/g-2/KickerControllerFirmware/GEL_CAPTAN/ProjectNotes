Alright, here are the project notes.  This is where I will put notes and documentation about the project, especially the 
schematic design where comments are not supported very well.  

I am currently working on redesigning the test modules.  The system involves a multiplexer that selects input from a
different source.  The address space is as follows: 

Multiplexer Address: 6

X = data input select

00000500 0000000000000XXX

000 = NTB (Name That Bit)
001 = OIA (One Is All)
010 = Sawtooth Wave
011 = 
100 = 
101 = 
110 = 
111 = ADC INPUT

Psudo Input Configuration:

These bits set up the selected psudo input.  What each register does depends on the psudo input mode that is selected.  

00000600 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

X = As Defined Below:

NTB:

Name That Bit allows you to set each input bit indivisually.  

00000000DDCCBBAA

AA = Rising Sample One
BB = Rising Sample Two
CC = Falling Sample One
DD = Falling Sample Two

OIA:

One Is All allows you to set one number that is set for each sample.  

00000000000000XX

X = Sample Value



TRIG_ATTRIBUTES: 5

00000000XXYYYYZZ

XX = Delay time for data_send module in clocks
YYYY = Number of samples to read after trig
ZZ = Threshold for the Peak_Finder module.   

STEPS TO LOCK CLOCKS:

Master_CLK cleanup: dcm_reset_0, DCM_RESET_MAP, rxdata(0)
Master_CLK to 375: dcm_reset_1, DCM_RESET_MAP, rxdata(4)
375 to 675: dcm_reset_2, DCM_RESET_MAP, rxdata(8)

FADC_CLK cleanup: fadc_dclk_reset, FADC_DELAY_MAP, rxdata(8)
